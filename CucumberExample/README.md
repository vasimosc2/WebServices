This project shows a setup of a Java project for Cucumber and Mockito. It works together with both JUnit 4 and JUnit 5 and Java 8 and Java >= 11. 

For using Cucumber in Eclipse, you want to install the Cucumber plugin. In Eclipse, installing the Cucumber plugin is offered to you once you try to open a file with extension .feature. After the plugin is installled and Eclipse is restarted, you can select the project and then choose in the right button menu "Configure::Convert to Cucumber Project ...". This allows you later in a feature file to jump directly to the corresponding step definitions by using Crtl when selecting a step definition and then clicking.

When you use this project as a starting point, please remember to remove those feature files and classes that were just included for demonstration purposes.

**Important for IntelliJ**, rebuild the project from the build menu after loading the example to ensure that IntelliJ finds the step definition classes.
